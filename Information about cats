 <p>Okay. Cats are pretty crazy. I have lots of experence about cats. You should stick with my books. So, now I will tell you a crazy cat story.</p>
 
 <p>Explore started the weaning process kind of late. If you don’t know what the weaning process is, I’ll tell you what it is. It means that Explore is trying to stop the kittens from drinking her milk. She sometimes hisses and attacks the kittens when they get near her. But when Explore distracted like when she’s eating food or drinking water the kittens have an opportunity to suck Explore's milk. But remember Explore is an adult cat she can fight back. When the kittens were little, they sucked on Explore so long that they would fall asleep at her stomach. The kittens are milk crazy. Speaking of milk, we stopped giving the cats milk, so Mission is back to normal. Mission can drink milk from Explore’s stomach but not milk with lactose because Mission is lactose intolerant. Read book 14 and book 15 to learn more about that. Poor Explore being sucked by the kittens. Hopefully she can finally finish the weaning process successfully. Really, Explore’s got to get the weaning process over with. Right now!!! The kittens are too old to be drinking milk. They're like 5 months old.  </p>
 
 <p>So, based on that story, we now know what the weaning process is. In the comment section, say what you think the cat's weaning process is.</p>
